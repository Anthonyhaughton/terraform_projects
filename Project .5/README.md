# Creating a EC2 Instance

## Intro to Terraform 

For this Project I built a EC2 node in a public subnet. This build covered making items in a VPC like a subnet, igw, route table/route to igw, sgs, deploying an image via EC2 using a predefined AMI.

The biggest thing I learned was how helpful the Hasicorp docs are. They give you most/if not all possible options per resource and it helps a bunch when trying to build items.

My code for this build was kind of sloppy and I don't think it follows best coding practices, but as I build more and learn how to structure the builds it should hopefully get better.
