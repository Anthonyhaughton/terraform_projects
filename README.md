# Terraform

Terraform has been super fun to learn. It's cool to see infrastructure being built
from a few lines of code. I really think having a solid understanding of some kind 
of IaC tool goes a long way in the cloud. Here you can find some IaC projects I've
been working. Most of them have their own readme's. Others are in separate repos,
I did this so I can make CI/CD projects with Jenkins.
